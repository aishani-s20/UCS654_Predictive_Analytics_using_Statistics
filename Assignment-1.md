## 💡 Implementation Details

### 🔹 Part 1: Mathematical Implementation (CLI)
A standalone Python utility designed to perform multi-criteria decision-making analysis on CSV datasets.
* **Core Logic:** Implements vector normalization, ideal best/worst identification, and Euclidean distance calculation.
* **Error Handling:** Includes strict checks for file existence, column consistency, and non-numeric data types.
* **Execution Command:**
    ```bash
    python topsis.py <InputFile.csv> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputFile.csv>
    ```
    *Sample:* `python topsis.py data.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "+,+,-,+" ranking.csv`

### 🔹 Part 2: PyPI Package
The core algorithm has been modularized and published to the Python Package Index, allowing for global accessibility and easy integration into other projects.
* **Library Name:** `TOPSIS-Aishani-102303250`
* **Installation Method:**
    ```bash
    pip install TOPSIS-Aishani-102303250
    ```
* **Registry Link:** [View on PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/TOPSIS-Aishani-102303250/)

### 🔹 Part 3: TOPSIS Web Service
A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that removes the need for coding knowledge. This service processes data and delivers results asynchronously.
* **Capabilities:**
    * Drag-and-drop CSV upload.
    * Dynamic input fields for weights and impacts.
    * **Automated Emailing:** Results are sent directly to the user's provided email address via SMTP.
* **Live Deployment:** [Launch Application](https://topsiswebapp.streamlit.app/)
